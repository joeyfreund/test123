Some notes and examples of basic NodeJS (and JS in general) concepts.

### Creating a project using `npm`

 * In a new directory, run `npm init` (guide you through creating `package.json`).
 * Create `src/index.js` (or whichever path appears as `main` in your `package.json`)
 * Edit `package.json`, and add the `start` script (the to `scripts` objects)
 * Run `npm run start`
